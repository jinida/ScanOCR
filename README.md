# About
This is a comprehensive utility application designed to utilize the PPOCRv4 model for optical character recognition (OCR). It incorporates OpenVino for runtime efficiency in C++ and includes a suite of image preprocessing and postprocessing algorithms written in C++. The user interface is crafted in C#, providing an intuitive and seamless experience for Windows users. The application features a Windows capture function and supports two primary modes: Capture Mode and Folder Mode Inference.

A collection of various WPF. Supports .NET 5 - 7 (WPF). Originally developed for design other WPF projects.
